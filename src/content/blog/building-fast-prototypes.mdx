# Building Fast Prototypes

When it comes to rapid prototyping, speed is everything. I've found that the key is to focus on the core functionality first and iterate based on real user feedback.

## Start with the essentials

Don't get caught up in perfecting every detail. Build what's necessary to test your hypothesis, ship it, and learn from real usage.

## Tools matter

Choose tools that get out of your way. Whether it's a no-code platform or your favorite framework, use what helps you move fastest.

## Iterate quickly

The first version is never the final version. Embrace feedback and be ready to pivot when needed.
