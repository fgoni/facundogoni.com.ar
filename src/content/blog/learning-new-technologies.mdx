# Learning New Technologies

The web development landscape changes constantly. Here's how I stay up to date without burning out.

## Focus on fundamentals

New frameworks come and go, but core concepts remain. Understanding the fundamentals makes learning new tools much easier.

## Build real projects

Reading documentation is great, but nothing beats building something real. Even small projects help cement new concepts.

## Join the community

Connect with others learning the same technology. Share your progress, ask questions, and help others when you can.
