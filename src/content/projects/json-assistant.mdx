A fast, privacy-first JSON viewer and formatter for macOS. JSON Assistant provides a beautiful, developer-friendly interface for working with JSON data. Paste JSON, drop a file, or open from Share Sheet—then pretty-print, explore the tree, and save your snippets. The UI uses a warm, high-contrast sepia theme that's easy on the eyes without sacrificing legibility.

## Overview

JSON Assistant solves the common problem of working with JSON data on macOS. Whether you're debugging API responses, analyzing configuration files, inspecting webhooks, or working with server logs, this app provides a clean, native interface for all your JSON manipulation needs. All processing happens on-device for speed and privacy—no network required.

## Challenges & Solutions

Building a native macOS app that balances functionality with privacy required careful architecture. The app processes all JSON data locally, ensuring no data leaves the device. The warm, high-contrast sepia theme was designed to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions while maintaining excellent readability. Implementing JSON Path search across both the sidebar and formatted view required thoughtful UI/UX design to keep the interface clean and intuitive.

## Results & Impact

JSON Assistant is now available on the Mac App Store, providing developers with a privacy-first tool for working with JSON data. The app has been well-received for its simplicity, speed, and beautiful interface. The warm sepia theme has been particularly appreciated by developers who spend long hours working with JSON data.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced the importance of building focused, single-purpose tools that solve specific problems well. It also taught me the value of prioritizing user experience details like theme design and keyboard shortcuts. The privacy-first approach demonstrated that powerful tools don't need to compromise user data, and on-device processing can actually improve performance.
